# Clubroot-hydroponics
Clubroot disease severity levels

This document describes and allows running the analysis conducted in the article "A Hydroponic-Based Bioassay to Facilitate Plasmodiophora brassicae Phenotyping" from Salih et al. 2023. In this study, we used the clubroot-infected root surface area to quantify and establish the disease severity levels. We used the root surface area and the visually estimated infection levels to compare the disease severity of the clubroot disease. Ultimately, this method removes the subjective evaluation and aids in detecting differences in the root architecture that visual assessments are unable to capture, leading to an improvement over previous assessments of clubroot disease in Brassica crops.
